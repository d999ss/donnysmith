## Philosophy & Approach

**Methodology**
* First-principles thinking: Strip down to core truths before building solutions
* High-craft execution: Every pixel, word, and motion element is deliberate
* Story-first design: Products must communicate a narrative people care about
* Rapid iteration with precision: Speed and quality are not mutually exclusive
